# UnityUtilityTest

Welcome to the horribly named UnityUtilityTest project. 
This project is intended to serve as a foundation for creating utility methods and game mechanics in Unity, which hopefully, in the future, will serve me and the developers in need. 
Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this project aims to offer something, maybe some stuff you feel too lazy to code or something you were never able to. Doesn't matter.

Project Overview

This project is structured to facilitate the development of utility methods and game mechanics in Unity. This section will be updated whenever I add a new function within the project. It includes:

    ARKManager: A Singleton manager class responsible for managing utility methods and game-related functionality.
    ARKLogger: A logging utility class for debugging and monitoring game behavior.

Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have ideas for improving existing utility methods, adding new features, or fixing bugs, please feel free to submit pull requests.
