# UnityUtilityTest

Welcome to the horribly named UnityUtilityTest project. 
This project is intended to serve as a foundation for creating utility methods and game mechanics in Unity, which hopefully, in the future, will serve me and the developers in need. 
Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this project aims to offer something, maybe some stuff you feel too lazy to code or something you were never able to. Doesn't matter.

Project Overview

This project is structured to facilitate the development of utility methods and game mechanics in Unity. This section will be updated whenever I add a new function within the project. It includes:

    ARKManager: A Singleton manager class responsible for managing utility methods and game-related functionality.
    ARKLogger: A logging utility class for debugging and monitoring game behavior.

Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

    Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/unity-game-development-project.git

    Open in Unity: Open the project folder in Unity Hub and select the Unity version compatible with the project.

    Run the Example: Run the example scene included in the project to see the utility methods in action. Experiment with different parameters and configurations to understand their behavior.

    Extend and Customize: Feel free to extend and customize the utility methods to fit your specific game requirements. Add new functionality, optimize existing code, and experiment with new ideas.
